Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand the key factors that influenced passenger survival.
The analysis uses Python, along with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, to uncover trends, patterns, correlations, and anomalies in the dataset.

 Objectives

Understand dataset structure and statistical properties

Visualize numeric distributions (Age, Fare, SibSp, Parch)

Detect outliers using boxplots

Analyze feature relationships using correlation heatmaps

Identify key patterns affecting survival (Pclass, Age, Fare, etc.)

Generate insights useful for machine learning models

 Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas – Data manipulation

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Seaborn – Advanced visualizations

(Optional) Plotly – Interactive visualizations

Jupyter Notebook.
